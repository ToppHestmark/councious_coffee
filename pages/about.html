        Conscious Coffee opened over 10 years ago, in 2007, when Ola Norman and Kari Norman moved from 
        their tiny village apartment to start a small coffee business in Oslo, Norway. At the time 
        they simply wanted to serve neighborhood locals the best coffee the area had to offer. Since then 
        Oslo has grown to be a place Ola and Kari could only have dreamed of, evolving to become a 
        respected establishment with a name that is synonymous with the best coffee in the town - 
        their own coffee, roasted in their trusty small-batch roaster as Conscious Coffee.

        Expect to find exceptional coffee when you visit our shops. Whether you order an expertly 
        prepared espresso drink or one of our cold- brewed single origin iced coffees, our aim is to 
        prepare your coffee with the same amount of care and insight that went into roasting it, and thatâ€™s saying something.

        Our mission is to offer a positive experience for all involved: the best coffee for our customers; 
        the best work environment, training and support for our staff; support for our fellow local businesses 
        by utilizing their products; and participating in and donating to local causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our premium coffee beans come from farmers who use ecologically and socially sustainable practices, 
        helping to support a healthy ecosystem and to provide a fair living for their workers. These are the only 
        farms that can produce the high quality coffee we use. The care that goes into growing, shipping and finally 
        roasting these coffees is reflected in the flavor of the finished product.
